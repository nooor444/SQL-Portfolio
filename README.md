# SQL-Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my SQL practice and projects.  
It includes selected solutions to LeetCode challenges and mini case studies using real-world datasets.  

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate my ability to write clean, well-documented SQL queries, explain my thought process, and apply SQL in practical scenarios.  

---
Skills Demonstrated
- Writing complex queries with JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, and window functions
- Data aggregation, filtering, and ranking 
- Designing schemas and data models for real-world scenarios  
- Applying SQL to analyze datasets and provide business insights  

---
Example Queries
- [Top 5 Customers by Spend](LeetCode/Medium/problem1.sql)  
- [Monthly Sales Trends](Case-Studies/E-commerce-Analysis.sql)  
- [Identifying Active Users](LeetCode/Easy/problem2.sql)  

---
Datasets Used
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (for case studies)  
- Sample company transactions, customer, and product data (self-created for practice)  

---
Future Plans
- Add more advanced case studies (e.g., NYC Taxi data, COVID-19 analysis)  
- Explore query optimization techniques  
- Expand into ETL and data modeling projects
